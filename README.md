## Data Cleaning for JSON Schema

### Overview

This project outlines a streamlined approach to prepare and organize data into a JSON schema, enabling flexible and efficient use with various AI models without intensive fine-tuning.

### Rationale

Instead of fine-tuning AI models using resource-intensive methods like LoRA, this approach leverages a clean JSON schema to feed structured data into different models. This allows rapid experimentation with various models without the need for repeated and costly fine-tuning, making it easier to test multiple models in a short period.

### Prerequisites

* Python installed
* `pandas` library (`pip install pandas`)

### Steps

1. **Converting .txt to .csv**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the .txt file
   with open('input.txt', 'r') as file:
       data = file.read().split('\n\n')  # Assuming each entry is separated by a blank line

   # Parse the data
   rows = []
   for entry in data:
       if entry.strip():
           lines = entry.split('\n')
           title = lines[0]
           lyrics = '\n'.join(lines[1:])
           rows.append({'title': title, 'lyrics': lyrics})

   # Convert to DataFrame and save as .csv
   df = pd.DataFrame(rows)
   df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
   ```

2. **Converting .csv to JSON**

   ```python
   # Load the .csv file
   df = pd.read_csv('output.csv')

   # Convert to JSON and save
   df.to_json('output.json', orient='records', lines=True)
   ```

### Example

* **Input (`input.txt`)**:

  ```
  Song Title 1
  These are the lyrics of the first song.

  Song Title 2
  These are the lyrics of the second song.
  ```
* **Output (`output.json`)**:

  ```json
  {"title": "Song Title 1", "lyrics": "These are the lyrics of the first song."}
  {"title": "Song Title 2", "lyrics": "These are the lyrics of the second song."}
  ```

Understood. Here’s a **clear, actionable guide** (just the steps, no code yet), followed by an **Examples** section with code and quick explanations.

## JSON Schema Integration Workflow

### 1. Prepare Your JSON Schema

Define the schema structure you need (e.g., fields like `title`, `lyrics`, etc.) and make sure your data conforms to it.

### 2. Host Your JSON Files

Upload your JSON files to a reliable online location (GitHub repo, AWS S3, Google Drive with sharing enabled, etc.) so they can be accessed programmatically.

### 3. Fetch the JSON Data in Your Code

Write code to download or access the JSON file from your hosted location.

### 4. Load and Use the Data

Parse the downloaded JSON into your application’s memory (as a dictionary, object, etc.) and integrate it with your model or processing pipeline.

### 5. Test the Integration & Iterate

Verify that your code correctly accesses, parses, and uses the JSON schema. Swap in different schemas or connect to various models as needed. Iterate to iron out issues.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple JSON Schema Structure

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Song Title 1",
    "lyrics": "These are the lyrics of song 1."
  },
  {
    "title": "Song Title 2",
    "lyrics": "These are the lyrics of song 2."
  }
]
```

*Reference: The expected format for your data file.*

---

### Example 2: Uploading to GitHub

* Place your `songs.json` file in your repo, e.g., `https://github.com/youruser/yourrepo/blob/main/songs.json`.
* Use the raw file link (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youruser/yourrepo/main/songs.json`) to fetch data programmatically.

---

### Example 3: Python Code to Fetch and Load JSON

```python
import requests

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youruser/yourrepo/main/songs.json"
data = requests.get(url).json()
print(data[0]['title'])  # Outputs: Song Title 1
```

*Reference: Fetching and parsing a JSON file in Python from GitHub.*

---

### Example 4: Using the Schema with a Model (Pseudocode)

```python
for song in data:
    result = model.generate(song['lyrics'])  # Replace 'model.generate' with your AI call
    print(f"Generated output for {song['title']}: {result}")
```

### Example 5: Swapping Schema for Another Artist

* Replace the URL with a different JSON file (e.g., `songs_feid.json` vs `songs_badbunny.json`).
* No code change needed, just point to the new resource.

```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youruser/yourrepo/main/songs_feid.json"
data = requests.get(url).json()
# ...rest as above
```

**That’s it.** Steps first, then clear code and usage examples. Let me know if you want this as a Markdown for your README, or need platform-specific code.
